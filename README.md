## Introduction

LeetCode is a fantastic platform for honing your problem-solving skills and preparing for technical interviews. This repository is my collection of solutions to LeetCode problems, which I continuously update as I solve more problems. Each solution includes the problem statement, the approach I used, and the code implementation.

## Structure

The repository is organized into folders based on the difficulty level of the problems:

- `Easy/`
- `Medium/`
- `Hard/`

Within each difficulty folder, the problems are further organized by topic:

- `Arrays/`
- `Strings/`
- `LinkedList/`
- `Trees/`
- `Graphs/`
- `DynamicProgramming/`
- `Backtracking/`
- `Others/`
